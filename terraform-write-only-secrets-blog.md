# Terraform 1.11 Game Changer: Write-Only Secrets That Never Touch Your State File

*Finally, truly secure secrets management in Terraform without the state file security nightmare*

## The Problem We've All Been Facing

If you've been using Terraform for any length of time, you've probably lost sleep over this question: **"How do I manage secrets securely without storing them in plain text in my state file?"**

For years, Terraform practitioners have been caught in a security dilemma:
- Store secrets in Terraform state ‚Üí Security risk 
- Don't use Terraform for secrets ‚Üí Infrastructure as Code gaps
- Use external secret management ‚Üí Complex workflows and drift

Today, that changes. **Terraform 1.11 introduces write-only attributes and ephemeral resources**, fundamentally transforming how we handle secrets in Infrastructure as Code. This guide demonstrates the features using **Terraform v1.12.1** and **Vault v1.18.4** with a comprehensive educational demo that includes real PostgreSQL dynamic secrets.

## What Are Write-Only Attributes?

Write-only attributes are a revolutionary new feature that allows you to:
- ‚úÖ Pass secret values to Terraform resources
- ‚úÖ Use them in your infrastructure provisioning
- ‚úÖ **Never store them in plan or state files**
- ‚úÖ Accept ephemeral values that don't need to be consistent between plan and apply

Think of them as "write-only memory" for Terraform - you can write to them, but they're never persisted or read back.

## Educational Demo: See the Problem First, Then the Solution

I've created a comprehensive educational demo that shows both the problem AND the solution. This approach is perfect for learning and presentations because you experience the security nightmare first-hand, then see the dramatic improvement.

### Phase 1: The Security Nightmare (Educational)

Let's start by demonstrating what happens when you DON'T use write-only attributes:

```bash
# Start the educational demo sequence
./scripts/start-postgres-dev.sh
./scripts/start-vault-dev.sh
source scripts/setup-env.sh

# Show the DANGEROUS traditional approach first
./scripts/demo-insecure-secrets.sh
```

Here's what the insecure demo (`examples/insecure/insecure-demo.tf`) shows:

```hcl
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  DANGEROUS: Traditional approach using regular data_json
resource "vault_kv_secret_v2" "insecure_database_config" {
  mount = vault_mount.insecure_demo.path
  name  = "database/postgres"
  
  # üíÄ SECURITY NIGHTMARE: Using regular data_json attribute
  # These secrets will be VISIBLE in:
  # 1. terraform plan output (masked as "sensitive" but still dangerous)
  # 2. terraform.tfstate file in plain text!
  # 3. Any logs or CI/CD outputs that capture state
  data_json = jsonencode({
    host     = "production-db.company.com"
    port     = "5432"
    database = "myapp"
    username = "app_user"
    password = "super-secret-db-password-123" # üíÄ EXPOSED!
    ssl_mode = "require"
  })
}

# ‚ö†Ô∏è  DANGEROUS: Database connection with exposed root password
resource "vault_database_secret_backend_connection" "insecure_postgres" {
  postgresql {
    # üíÄ This root password will be VISIBLE in terraform.tfstate!
    username = "postgres"
    password = "super-secret-db-password-123" # üíÄ EXPOSED IN STATE!
  }
}
```

When you run the insecure demo, you'll see:

1. **Terraform plan looks safe** - shows `(sensitive value)` 
2. **But the state file reveals everything** - `grep "super-secret-db-password-123" terraform.tfstate` finds 7+ matches!
3. **Complete credential exposure** - anyone with state file access can extract all production secrets

### Phase 2: The Revolutionary Solution

Now run the secure demo to see the dramatic difference:

```bash
# Show the SECURE approach with write-only attributes
./scripts/demo-secure-secrets.sh
```

Here's what the secure demo (`examples/secure/complete-demo.tf`) demonstrates:

```hcl
# ‚úÖ SECURE: Store database credentials using write-only attributes
resource "vault_kv_secret_v2" "database_config" {
  mount = vault_mount.demo.path
  name  = "database/postgres"
  
  # üîí WRITE-ONLY ATTRIBUTE: Secrets never stored in state!
  data_json_wo = jsonencode({
    host     = "production-db.company.com"
    port     = "5432"
    database = "myapp"
    username = "app_user"
    password = "super-secret-db-password-123" # üîí PROTECTED!
    ssl_mode = "require"
  })
  
  # Version tracking for secure updates
  data_json_wo_version = var.secret_version
}

# ‚úÖ SECURE: Database connection using write-only password
resource "vault_database_secret_backend_connection" "postgres" {
  postgresql {
    # üîí WRITE-ONLY ATTRIBUTE: Root password never stored in state!
    username            = "postgres"
    password_wo         = "super-secret-db-password-123" # üîí PROTECTED!
    password_wo_version = var.secret_version
  }
}
```

When you run `terraform plan`, you'll see:

```
# vault_kv_secret_v2.database_config will be created
+ resource "vault_kv_secret_v2" "database_config" {
    + data_json_wo         = (write-only attribute)  # üîí Never shown!
    + data_json_wo_version = 1
    + id                   = (known after apply)
    + mount                = "demo-secrets"
    + name                 = "database/postgres"
  }
```

And most importantly, when you check the state file:

```bash
cat terraform.tfstate | grep -A 3 -B 1 '"data_json_wo":'
# Output: "data_json_wo": null,

grep "super-secret-db-password-123" terraform.tfstate
# Output: (empty - no matches!)
```

## Advanced Demo: Write-Only Attributes + Ephemeral Resources

The repository includes a complete secure demo (`examples/secure/complete-demo.tf`) that shows the full integration of write-only attributes with ephemeral resources. This is where the real power becomes apparent.

### Ephemeral Resources: Retrieving Secrets Without State Storage

```hcl
# ‚úÖ SECURE: Retrieve database config without storing in state
ephemeral "vault_kv_secret_v2" "db_config" {
  mount = vault_mount.demo.path
  name  = vault_kv_secret_v2.database_config.name
  
  # Defer until mount is created
  mount_id = vault_mount.demo.id
}

# ‚úÖ SECURE: Generate dynamic database credentials (ephemeral)
ephemeral "vault_database_secret" "dynamic_db_creds" {
  mount = vault_mount.database.path
  name  = vault_database_secret_backend_role.app_role.name
  
  # Defer until database role is created
  mount_id = vault_mount.database.id
}
```

### Secret Composition: The Ultimate Security Model

```hcl
# ‚úÖ SECURE: Create composite configuration using ephemeral secrets
resource "vault_kv_secret_v2" "complete_app_config" {
  mount = vault_mount.demo.path
  name  = "app/complete-secure-config"
  
  # üîí WRITE-ONLY ATTRIBUTE: Complete config - never stored in state
  data_json_wo = jsonencode({
    # Static database connection using ephemeral retrieval
    database_url = format(
      "postgresql://%s:%s@%s:%s/%s?sslmode=%s",
      ephemeral.vault_kv_secret_v2.db_config.data.username,
      ephemeral.vault_kv_secret_v2.db_config.data.password,
      ephemeral.vault_kv_secret_v2.db_config.data.host,
      ephemeral.vault_kv_secret_v2.db_config.data.port,
      ephemeral.vault_kv_secret_v2.db_config.data.database,
      ephemeral.vault_kv_secret_v2.db_config.data.ssl_mode
    )
    
    # Dynamic database credentials (auto-expiring)
    dynamic_database = {
      username = tostring(ephemeral.vault_database_secret.dynamic_db_creds.username)
      password = tostring(ephemeral.vault_database_secret.dynamic_db_creds.password)
      ttl      = "1h"
    }
    
    # Application metadata
    security_level = "MAXIMUM - NO SECRETS IN STATE!"
    approach       = "Write-only attributes + Ephemeral resources"
  })
  
  data_json_wo_version = var.secret_version
}
```

This demonstrates the complete security model:
- **Static secrets** stored with write-only attributes
- **Dynamic secrets** generated on-demand with auto-expiration
- **Secret composition** combining ephemeral resources into new configurations
- **Zero state exposure** - no secrets ever stored in Terraform state

## Real PostgreSQL Dynamic Secrets: The Complete Demo

The demo includes a real PostgreSQL database running in Docker to showcase Vault's database secrets engine with actual auto-expiring credentials.

### Testing Dynamic Credentials

When you run the complete demo, you can actually test dynamic credentials:

```bash
# Generate dynamic PostgreSQL credentials
vault read database/creds/app-role
# Output:
# Key                Value
# ---                -----
# lease_id           database/creds/app-role/ybbtk7vwL5jeQB7QIAGqkdP8
# lease_duration     1h
# lease_renewable    true
# password           ORC71M1C-mZjT1ewqkYt
# username           v-token-app-role-PbzYtG6qwATCcteSSX6j-1750864908

# Test the actual database connection
docker exec -it terraform-demo-postgres psql \
  -U v-token-app-role-PbzYtG6qwATCcteSSX6j-1750864908 \
  -d postgres \
  -c "SELECT current_user, now(), 'Dynamic credentials work!' as message;"
```

The result? **Real PostgreSQL users created by Vault that automatically expire after 1 hour!**

## Educational Script Features

The demo scripts (`scripts/demo-insecure-secrets.sh` and `scripts/demo-secure-secrets.sh`) provide a complete educational experience:

### Insecure Demo Script Features:
- ‚úÖ Shows traditional approach security problems
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates state file secret exposure with real searches
- ‚úÖ Analyzes attack vectors and security impact

## How Updates Work

Since write-only attributes aren't stored in state, updates work through version tracking:

```bash
# Update secrets by incrementing version
terraform apply -var="secret_version=2"

# The plan will show:
# ~ data_json_wo_version = 1 -> 2
# Secret values are never shown in plan output!
```

- **Educational workflow** showing problem ‚Üí solution
- **Real database integration** with PostgreSQL
- **Complete state file analysis** for security verification

...represents a fundamental shift in how we approach Infrastructure as Code security.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How do write-only attributes differ from sensitive variables?

**A:** Sensitive variables are masked in output but still stored in state files. Write-only attributes are **never stored anywhere** - not in plan files, state files, or logs. They're truly write-only.

```hcl
# Sensitive variable - still stored in state as sensitive
variable "db_password" {
  sensitive = true
}

# Write-only attribute - never stored anywhere
resource "vault_kv_secret_v2" "config" {
  data_json_wo = jsonencode({
    password = "secret"  # Never stored!
  })
}
```

### Q: How do updates work if the values aren't stored in state?

**A:** Updates use version tracking. When you change a write-only attribute, increment the version to signal Terraform that an update is needed:

```hcl
resource "vault_kv_secret_v2" "config" {
  data_json_wo         = jsonencode({...})
  data_json_wo_version = var.secret_version  # Increment to update
}
```

### Q: What happens during `terraform import` with resources that have write-only attributes?

**A:** Write-only attributes are set to `null` during import since their values can't be read from the existing resource. You'll need to provide the values and version during the next apply.

### Q: Can I use write-only attributes with all Terraform providers?

**A:** No, providers must explicitly support write-only attributes. The HashiCorp Vault provider added support in recent versions. Check provider documentation for `*_wo` and `*_wo_version` attributes.

### Q: Are there any performance implications?

**A:** Write-only attributes can actually improve performance because:
- Smaller state files (no secret storage)
- Reduced plan/apply times (less data to process)
- Better CI/CD performance (secrets not transferred in state)

### Q: Can I migrate existing configurations to use write-only attributes?

**A:** Yes! Here's the migration approach:

```hcl
# Before (insecure)
resource "vault_kv_secret_v2" "config" {
  data_json = jsonencode({
    password = "secret"
  })
}

# After (secure) - rename attribute and add version
resource "vault_kv_secret_v2" "config" {
  data_json_wo         = jsonencode({
    password = "secret"
  })
  data_json_wo_version = 1
}
```

**Migration steps:**
1. Update configuration with `*_wo` attributes
2. Run `terraform apply` - Terraform will update the resource
3. Verify secrets are no longer in state file

### Q: Do I need ephemeral resources to use write-only attributes?

**A:** No, they're independent features:
- **Write-only attributes** = Store secrets without state persistence
- **Ephemeral resources** = Retrieve secrets without state persistence
- **Together** = Complete secure secrets workflow

### Q: How do I troubleshoot issues with write-only attributes?

**A:** Common troubleshooting approaches:

```bash
# 1. Verify provider supports write-only attributes
terraform providers schema -json | jq '.provider_schemas."registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/vault"'

# 2. Check for version mismatches
terraform plan  # Look for version changes

# 3. Enable detailed logging
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
terraform apply

# 4. Verify secrets aren't in state
grep -r "your-secret-value" terraform.tfstate  # Should return empty
```

### Q: What Terraform versions support these features?

**A:** 
- **Write-only attributes**: Terraform 1.11+
- **Ephemeral resources**: Terraform 1.10+
- **This demo uses**: Terraform v1.12.1 with Vault provider

### Q: Can I use write-only attributes in modules?

**A:** Yes! Pass secrets through module variables:

```hcl
# Module usage
module "secure_vault" {
  source = "./modules/vault-secrets"
  
  secret_data    = var.database_credentials
  secret_version = var.secret_version
}

# Module definition
resource "vault_kv_secret_v2" "config" {
  data_json_wo         = var.secret_data
  data_json_wo_version = var.secret_version
}
```

### Q: What happens if I accidentally use a regular attribute instead of write-only?

**A:** The demo shows exactly this scenario! Run `./scripts/demo-insecure-secrets.sh` to see how regular attributes expose secrets in state files. Always verify with:

```bash
# Check for exposed secrets (should return nothing with write-only)
grep "your-secret-value" terraform.tfstate
```
