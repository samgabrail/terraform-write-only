## SCRIPT

### [00:00 - 02:30] INTRO & PROBLEM STATEMENT

**[ON SCREEN: Terraform logo, state file with visible secrets]**

**HOST:** Hey everyone! If you've been using Terraform for infrastructure as code, you've probably lost sleep over this question: "How do I manage secrets securely without storing them in plain text in my state file?" 

**[SCREEN: Split screen showing state file with password visible]**

For years, we've been caught in this impossible security dilemma. Either we store secrets in Terraform state - which is a massive security risk - or we don't use Terraform for secrets management, creating gaps in our Infrastructure as Code approach.

**[SCREEN: Diagram showing the security trilemma]**

**HOST:** Well, that nightmare is officially over. Terraform 1.11 just dropped write-only attributes, and when combined with ephemeral resources, it completely transforms how we handle secrets in Infrastructure as Code.

**[SCREEN: Terraform 1.11 release notes highlight]**

But here's what makes this video special - I'm going to show you the security problem FIRST using an educational demo, then demonstrate the revolutionary solution. This isn't just about learning new features - it's about experiencing the dramatic security transformation that will change how you think about Infrastructure as Code forever.

### [02:30 - 04:00] EDUCATIONAL DEMO STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

**[SCREEN: Repository structure diagram]**

**HOST:** I've built a comprehensive educational demo with three tiers of examples:

**[HIGHLIGHTING STRUCTURE]**
```
terraform-write-only/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ insecure/          # üìö Shows the security problem
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ secure/            # ‚úÖ Basic write-only attributes
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ complete-demo.tf   # üöÄ Advanced integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ demo-insecure-secrets.sh   # üìö Educational problem demo
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ demo-secure-secrets.sh     # üìö Educational solution demo
```

**HOST:** The genius of this approach is that you'll see EXACTLY why write-only attributes are revolutionary by experiencing the security problem first-hand, then witnessing the dramatic improvement.

**[SCREEN: Educational flow diagram]**

We'll start with the traditional approach to show you the security nightmare, then move to the secure solution, and finally explore the advanced integration with ephemeral resources and real PostgreSQL dynamic secrets.

### [04:00 - 08:30] DANGEROUS DEMO: Traditional Approach (Educational)

**[SCREEN: Terminal with project directory]**

**HOST:** Let me show you why this is such a big problem. I'm going to demonstrate the traditional approach first, and you'll be shocked at what happens to your secrets.

**[TYPING IN TERMINAL]**
```bash
# Let's start our services
./scripts/start-postgres-dev.sh
./scripts/start-vault-dev.sh
source scripts/setup-env.sh
```

**HOST:** Now I'm going to run our educational insecure demo. This shows what happens when you DON'T use write-only attributes.

**[TYPING IN TERMINAL]**
```bash
# Run the DANGEROUS traditional approach
./scripts/demo-insecure-secrets.sh
```

**[SCREEN: Demo script running with educational output]**

**HOST:** Watch this educational script in action. It's not just running Terraform - it's analyzing the security implications every step of the way.

**[SCREEN: Insecure demo configuration]**

Let me show you what we're dealing with. This is the traditional approach using regular `data_json` instead of `data_json_wo`:

```hcl
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  DANGEROUS: Traditional approach
resource "vault_kv_secret_v2" "insecure_database_config" {
  # üíÄ SECURITY NIGHTMARE: Using regular data_json attribute
  data_json = jsonencode({
    password = "super-secret-db-password-123" # üíÄ EXPOSED!
    # ... other secrets
  })
}
```

**[SCREEN: Terraform plan output]**

**HOST:** Now here's the deceptive part - when I run terraform plan, it shows `(sensitive value)` which looks safe, right? This gives you a false sense of security!

**[SCREEN: Plan output showing (sensitive value)]**

The plan looks secure, but watch what happens when we apply this and examine the state file...

### [08:30 - 11:00] STATE FILE ANALYSIS: THE SECURITY NIGHTMARE REVEALED

**[SCREEN: Terminal running state file analysis]**

**HOST:** This is where the educational script really shines. It automatically analyzes the state file and shows you exactly what went wrong.

**[SCREEN: Educational script output showing state analysis]**

Look at this analysis:

```bash
# Searching for our "secret" password in the state file
grep -q 'super-secret-db-password-123' terraform.tfstate
# FOUND IT! The secret password is in the state file
```

**[SCREEN: Grep results showing multiple matches]**

**HOST:** SEVEN MATCHES! Our production database password appears 7 times in the state file. Let me show you what the educational script reveals:

**[SCREEN: Educational script showing security analysis]**

```bash
üî¢ Number of times our specific password appears in state:
7

üíÄ Raw JSON in state exposes complete database credentials
```

**[SCREEN: State file JSON showing exposed secrets]**

**HOST:** The educational script doesn't just tell you there's a problem - it shows you exactly how bad it is. Anyone with access to this state file can extract:
- Database passwords
- Root credentials  
- Complete connection details
- Everything needed to access production systems!

**[SCREEN: Attack vector analysis from script]**

The script analyzes the attack vectors too:
- State files in version control (Git)
- State files in CI/CD logs
- Shared state backends (S3, Terraform Cloud)
- Developer machines with state files
- Backup systems containing state files

This is why write-only attributes are REVOLUTIONARY!

### [11:00 - 15:30] SECURE DEMO: Write-Only Attributes Solution

**[SCREEN: Terminal]**

**HOST:** Now let me show you the secure approach. Watch this dramatic transformation:

**[TYPING IN TERMINAL]**
```bash
# Run the SECURE demo with write-only attributes
./scripts/demo-secure-secrets.sh
```

**[SCREEN: Secure demo script running]**

**HOST:** This educational script is comprehensive. It guides you through every step, explains what's happening, and verifies the security improvements.

**[SCREEN: Secure configuration]**

Here's our secure configuration using write-only attributes:

```hcl
# ‚úÖ SECURE: Store database credentials using write-only attributes
resource "vault_kv_secret_v2" "database_config" {
  # üîí WRITE-ONLY ATTRIBUTE: Secrets never stored in state!
  data_json_wo = jsonencode({
    password = "super-secret-db-password-123" # üîí PROTECTED!
    # ... other secrets
  })
  
  data_json_wo_version = var.secret_version
}
```

**[SCREEN: Terraform plan output]**

**HOST:** Now watch the plan output:

```
+ resource "vault_kv_secret_v2" "database_config" {
    + data_json_wo         = (write-only attribute)  # üîí Never shown!
    + data_json_wo_version = 1
    + name                 = "database/postgres"
  }
```

**[SCREEN: Educational script verification]**

The educational script automatically verifies the security:

```bash
üîê Let's search for secrets in the state file...
   Searching for: super-secret-db-password-123

‚úÖ EXCELLENT: Secret NOT found in state file!
```

**[SCREEN: State file showing null values]**

```bash
‚úÖ Database write-only attribute in state:
null

‚úÖ All write-only attributes show as: null
```

**HOST:** Look at that! The same secret that appeared 7 times in the insecure demo now appears ZERO times in the secure demo. The state file shows null for all write-only attributes.

### [15:30 - 18:00] ADVANCED DEMO: EPHEMERAL RESOURCES INTEGRATION

**[SCREEN: Advanced demo configuration]**

**HOST:** Now let me show you the advanced integration. The secure demo (`examples/secure/complete-demo.tf`) combines write-only attributes with ephemeral resources.

**[SCREEN: Secure demo file structure]**

```hcl
# ‚úÖ SECURE: Retrieve secrets without storing in state
ephemeral "vault_kv_secret_v2" "db_config" {
  mount = vault_mount.demo.path
  name  = vault_kv_secret_v2.database_config.name
}

# ‚úÖ SECURE: Secret composition using ephemeral + write-only
resource "vault_kv_secret_v2" "complete_app_config" {
  data_json_wo = jsonencode({
    # Database URL using ephemeral retrieval
    database_url = format("postgresql://%s:%s@%s...",
      ephemeral.vault_kv_secret_v2.db_config.data.username,
      ephemeral.vault_kv_secret_v2.db_config.data.password,
      # ... ephemeral secrets flow securely
    )
  })
}
```

**[SCREEN: Educational script showing ephemeral verification]**

**HOST:** The educational script verifies that ephemeral resources don't appear in state:

```bash
‚ö° Let's check ephemeral resources (they shouldn't be in state!)
   Command: terraform state list | grep ephemeral

‚úÖ PERFECT: No ephemeral resources in state file!
   Ephemeral resources are used during configuration but never persisted
```

This is incredible - secrets flow from Vault through ephemeral resources into write-only attributes without EVER touching the state file!

### [18:00 - 20:30] REAL POSTGRESQL DYNAMIC SECRETS TESTING

**[SCREEN: PostgreSQL integration]**

**HOST:** But wait, there's more! The demo includes real PostgreSQL dynamic secrets. Let me show you this in action:

**[SCREEN: Dynamic secrets configuration]**

```hcl
# ‚úÖ SECURE: Database connection using write-only password
resource "vault_database_secret_backend_connection" "postgres" {
  postgresql {
    # üîí Root password never stored in state
    password_wo         = "postgres-root-password-123"
    password_wo_version = var.secret_version
  }
}

# Generate dynamic credentials (ephemeral)
ephemeral "vault_database_secret" "dynamic_db_creds" {
  mount = vault_mount.database.path
  name  = vault_database_secret_backend_role.app_role.name
}
```

**[SCREEN: Educational script testing dynamic credentials]**

**HOST:** The educational script actually tests these dynamic credentials:

```bash
üîç Generate dynamic PostgreSQL credentials:
vault read database/creds/app-role

Generated dynamic user: v-token-app-role-PbzYtG6qwATCcteSSX6j-1750864908
Testing database connection...

‚úÖ SUCCESS: Dynamic credentials work perfectly!
```

**[SCREEN: Real PostgreSQL connection test]**

**HOST:** And here's the amazing part - we can connect to a real PostgreSQL database using these dynamically generated credentials:

```bash
docker exec terraform-demo-postgres psql \
  -U "v-token-app-role-PbzYtG6qwATCcteSSX6j-1750864908" \
  -d postgres \
  -c "SELECT current_user, 'Dynamic credentials work!' as message;"
```

These are real PostgreSQL users that automatically expire after 1 hour!

### [20:30 - 23:00] COMPLETE SECURITY VERIFICATION & STATE ANALYSIS

**[SCREEN: Comprehensive security analysis]**

**HOST:** The educational scripts provide complete security verification. Let me show you the comprehensive analysis:

**[SCREEN: Educational script security analysis]**

```bash
‚úÖ SECURITY ANALYSIS: WHAT WENT RIGHT?

üîê SECURE APPROACH BENEFITS:
   1. ‚úÖ Secrets show as '(write-only attribute)' in plan
   2. ‚úÖ Write-only attributes are 'null' in state file
   3. ‚úÖ Ephemeral resources don't appear in state at all
   4. ‚úÖ Secrets safely stored in Vault
   5. ‚úÖ Dynamic credentials work with real database
   6. ‚úÖ Complete functionality with zero state exposure

üõ°Ô∏è  ATTACK SURFACE ELIMINATED:
   ‚Ä¢ State files can be safely stored anywhere
   ‚Ä¢ CI/CD logs don't expose secrets
   ‚Ä¢ Developers can share state files
   ‚Ä¢ Backup systems are secure
   ‚Ä¢ Git repositories are safe
```

**[SCREEN: Before/after comparison]**

```bash
üìä BEFORE (Traditional approach):
   üíÄ terraform plan: Shows ALL secrets in plain text
   üíÄ terraform.tfstate: Contains ALL secrets in plain text
   üíÄ Attack surface: MASSIVE

üìä AFTER (Write-only attributes):
   ‚úÖ terraform plan: Shows '(write-only attribute)'
   ‚úÖ terraform.tfstate: Shows 'null' for write-only attributes
   ‚úÖ ephemeral resources: Don't appear in state at all
   ‚úÖ Attack surface: ELIMINATED
```

**HOST:** This side-by-side comparison shows the dramatic security improvement. It's not just about adding a feature - it's about fundamentally transforming the security model of Infrastructure as Code.

### [23:00 - 25:00] EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS & PRODUCTION BEST PRACTICES

**[SCREEN: Educational workflow diagram]**

**HOST:** This educational approach provides incredible benefits:

**[SCREEN: Learning benefits]**

1. **Problem First**: You see exactly why traditional approaches are dangerous
2. **Solution Second**: Experience the dramatic security improvement
3. **State Analysis**: Compare before/after state files side-by-side
4. **Real Testing**: Dynamic PostgreSQL credentials with actual database
5. **Complete Verification**: Thorough security analysis and testing

**[SCREEN: Production best practices]**

**HOST:** For production use, the demo teaches these best practices:

```hcl
# Always use version tracking
data_json_wo_version = var.secret_version

# Implement proper validation
variable "secret_version" {
  validation {
    condition     = var.secret_version > 0
    error_message = "Secret version must be positive."
  }
}
```

**[SCREEN: Update workflow]**

**HOST:** Updates are secure through version tracking:

```bash
# Update secrets by incrementing version
terraform apply -var="secret_version=2"

# Only version changes in plan - secrets never shown!
# ~ data_json_wo_version = 1 -> 2
```
